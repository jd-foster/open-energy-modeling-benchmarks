# TulipaEnergyModel

TulipaEnergyModel is an optimization model for the electricity market and its
coupling with other energy sectors (e.g., hydrogen, heat, natural gas, etc.).
The main objective is to determine the optimal investment and operation
decisions for different types of assets (e.g., producers, consumers,
conversions, storages, and transports).
