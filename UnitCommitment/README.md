# UnitCommitment.jl

UnitCommitment.jl (UC.jl) is an optimization package for the
Security-Constrained Unit Commitment Problem (SCUC), a fundamental optimization
problem in power systems used, for example, to clear the day-ahead electricity
markets. The package provides benchmark instances for the problem and Julia/JuMP
implementations of state-of-the-art mixed-integer programming formulations.
